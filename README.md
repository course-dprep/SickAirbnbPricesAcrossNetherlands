# A study on how the second lockdown in the Netherlands affected the AirBnb market in Amsterdam


Research question:To what extent is the effect of the second lockdown in the districts of Amsterdam on Airbnb prices?

## Motivation
At the end of 2019, the first infection of the corona virus was detected in China and since then this virus has gripped almost all countries in the world [Chen et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.00476/full).The Netherlands has also been affected by the corona virus and has had to take various measures to limit the spread of the corona virus. In December 2020, the Netherlands entered the second lockdown till May 2021.During this lockdown, the Netherlands had to deal with far-reaching measures.  Some examples of these gripping measures are:

* Keep 1.5 meters away from people who are not part of your household;
* All non-essential visiting locations were closed;
* Only use public transport if necessary.

The above examples are just a few examples of the measures which were applied during the second lockdown and it is almost inconceivable that these measures have not had an impact on the AirBnb market. Therefore, this study will pay attention to one of concequence of this second lockdown on the Airbnb market, namely price of the Airbnb accomondations.

Ultimately, this study will therefore answer the following questions:
* How did the prices of the Airbnbs in the specific location, Amsterdam change throughout the five months (December 2020, May 2021)within the districts of Amsterdam?
* At which districts was there significant price change and in which way was this price change?


With the information obtained from this study, AirBnb owners can more easily respond to the wishes of customers during the next pandemic or lockdown and thereby limit their economic damage from that pandemic/epidemic. Covid-19 is not the first pandemic/epidemic that the earth has known and research expects that it will not be the last (WHO, 2020). 
This study therefore helps AirBnb owners to prepare for the next pandemic/epidemic.

## Research method

## Way of deployment


## Data
For this research project Airbnb data will be used, accessed through [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).The datasets used in this project are all based in the listings in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and framed through the timeline 12 December 2020 including and to January 2021, February 2021, March 2021, April 2021 and 19 May 2021. These date frames are selected with accordance to the second COVID-19 lock-down dates (14 December 2020 -11 May 2021) in the Netherlands, where measures and restrictions are taken heavily towards COVID-19 where after May 11 the relaxation steps of these measures were taken.

## Method and results

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

## Repository overview

The repository consists of four folders (workflow, data, src, and gen), and three files (.gitignore, README.md, and dprep-sick.Rproj). The aim of the research project, instructions, running details and results are communicated in README.md file where you are currently viewing. The data being using in this project can be found in the data folder but can also be accessed through the src folder,make file where the overflow of running instructions for the analysis is also provided. 

## Running instructions

Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow. Touch upon, if necessary, the required input data, which (secret) credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (including links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.
